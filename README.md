# Artsy Workflow for Alfred

This is a workflow for Alfred that comes with a few neat commands:

```
'a' => go to the dotcom
'ag reponame' => open the repo in your default browser
'ah appname' => open the app's Heroku Dashboard in your default browser
'az zoomroomname' => open the Zoom room name
```
